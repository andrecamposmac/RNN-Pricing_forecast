# Monthly Sales Forecasting with RNN (LSTM)

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, to forecast monthly retail sales. The goal is to predict sales values for the next 12 months based on historical temporal data.

## Description

The notebook addresses the *Time Series Forecasting* problem using Deep Learning. The project pipeline includes:
1.  **Data Collection and Loading:** Reading historical sales data.
2.  **Preprocessing:**
    *   Converting the date column to index.
    *   Normalizing data using `MinMaxScaler` to scale values between 0 and 1 (crucial for neural networks).
    *   Creating temporal sequences (lags) using `TimeseriesGenerator`.
3.  **Modeling:** Building and training an LSTM network.
4.  **Validation:** Testing the model on unseen data (test set) and using *Early Stopping* to avoid overfitting.
5.  **Future Forecasting:** Generating predictions for 12 months beyond the original dataset.

## Dataset

The data represents **Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services**.

*   **Source:** [FRED - Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MRTSSM448USN)
*   **Unit:** Millions of Dollars (Not seasonally adjusted).
*   **Frequency:** Monthly.
*   **Period:** Data since 1992.

## Technologies and Libraries

*   **Python 3**
*   **TensorFlow / Keras:** For creating and training the neural network (LSTM).
*   **Pandas & NumPy:** Manipulation of time series and arrays.
*   **Scikit-learn:** Data normalization (`MinMaxScaler`).
*   **Matplotlib:** Visualization of sales charts and forecasts.

## Model Architecture

The neural network was configured as follows:
*   **Input:** Temporal sequences generated by `TimeseriesGenerator`.
*   **LSTM Layer:** 100 units (neurons).
*   **Dense Layer (Output):** 1 unit (predicted value).
*   **Optimizer:** Adam (Keras default).
*   **Loss Function:** MSE (Mean Squared Error).
*   **Callback:** EarlyStopping monitoring `val_loss` with patience of 2 epochs.

## Results

The model demonstrated ability to capture seasonality and trend in sales data.
*   The notebook compares **Actual Sales vs. Predictions** on the test set.
*   At the end, a table is generated with the **Forecast** (future prediction) for the period **November 2019 to October 2020**.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the `sales_price.csv` file or update the code to download directly from the source.
2.  Open the notebook `Pricing_forecast_RNN.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter.
3.  Adjust the file path in the loading cell:
    ```python
    df = pd.read_csv('path/to/sales_price.csv', ...)
    ```
4.  Execute all cells to train the model and visualize the predictions.
